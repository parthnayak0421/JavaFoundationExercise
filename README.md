## Variable & Data Type Exercise:

- Declare an `int` variable named `age` and initialize it with your age.
- Declare a `double` variable named `averageScore` and initialize it with any decimal value (e.g., 85.7).
- Declare a `char` variable named `grade` and initialize it with a character representing a grade (e.g., 'A').
- Declare a `boolean` variable named `isPassing` and initialize it to true or false based on any condition you like.
- Declare a `double` variable radius and assign it a value. Calculate and print the area of a circle using the formula 
`area = PI * radius * radius`. Use Math.PI for the value of PI.
- Declare two `int` variables, `num1` and `num2`. Initially, assign any value to `num1` and `num2`. Write code to swap 
their values with & without using a third variable and then print the result.
